title: "seqwrap - Item-by-item Iterative Model Fitting"
format: gfm

The `seqwrap` R package allows you to model high dimensional data using an item-by-item strategy with a specific model engine. Using `seqwrap` you can fit e.g. gene/transcript data from a RNA sequencing experiment to a model specified with random effects or custom distributions. This is possible as `seqwrap` efficiently iterates over all item (e.g. genes) and fits data to the same model formulation using any model fitting algorithm implemented in R. The package also provides pre- and post-fitting convenience functions.
