\description{
Simulate gene counts from a Negative Binomial distribution conditional
on a two-condition, repeated measures experiment with three time points. The
function is used for internal testing and tutorials.
}
\details{
The function simulation of counts from a conditional Negative Binomial
distribution where the \deqn{\mu = \text{exp}(\eta)}, and
\deqn{\eta = \beta_0 + \beta1 \text{conditionB} + \beta_2 \text{timet2} +
\beta_3 \text{timet3} + \beta_4 \text{conditionB:timet2} +\beta_5
\text{conditionB:timet3} + \text{offset}(\text{library size}) +
\text{b}_0 + \text{b}_1 + \text{b}_2}.
Varying effects are added as
\deqn{\text{b}_l \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_l)}. The library size is
used as an offset for simulating data. Library sizes are simulated from a
log-normal distribution or provided in library_size. In the simulation of
counts, the library size is entered as offset after scaling to the median
library size. Raw library sizes are included in the meta data.
The dispersion parameter can be simulated from a model (lm or loess)
provided to the function where the predictor variable should be
\deqn{\text{log}(\mu)} and
the outcome variable (dispersion) should be \deqn{\text{log}(\phi)}.
If no model is provided, values are simulated from
a log-normal distribution based on hard coded parameter values
from an observed mean-dispersion relationship.
